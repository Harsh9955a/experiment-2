# Experiment 2 – Web Mini Projects

This repository contains three small web development experiments: `counter`, `product-filter`, and `svg-drawing`. Each folder is an independent mini project.

## 1. Counter

A simple character/word counter that updates in real time as the user types into a text area. [cite:5][cite:6]

### Features
- Counts characters and/or words dynamically while typing. [cite:6]
- Clear/reset button to empty the input (if implemented).
- Basic, clean UI built for practice with DOM manipulation.

### How to Run
- Open the `index.html` file inside the `counter` folder in any modern browser.
- Start typing in the text area to see the count update.

## 2. Product Filter

A basic product listing page where users can filter items based on criteria such as name, category, or price range. [cite:4]

### Features
- Static list of products displayed in a grid or list.
- Input field(s) to filter products (e.g., search by name, filter by category, price, etc.).
- Instant filtering using JavaScript without page reload.

### How to Run
- Open the `index.html` file inside the `product-filter` folder in any modern browser.
- Use the search box or filter controls to narrow down the visible products.

## 3. SVG Drawing

An experiment with drawing shapes using SVG, such as circles or other basic shapes, controlled via HTML/JavaScript. [cite:2][cite:3]

### Features
- Uses SVG elements (like `<circle>`, `<rect>`, etc.) to draw shapes on the page.
- May include controls (inputs/sliders/buttons) to change size, color, or position of shapes.
- Demonstrates basic understanding of SVG and DOM scripting.

### How to Run
- Open the `index.html` file inside the `svg-drawing` (or `svg-drawing-circle`) folder in any modern browser.
- Interact with the controls (if present) to see the SVG update.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for basic styling.
- JavaScript for DOM manipulation, filtering logic, and SVG interactions.

## How to Use This Repo

- Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
- Open the folder of the experiment you want to see (`counter`, `product-filter`, or `svg-drawing`).
- Open the corresponding `index.html` file in a browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add more styling and responsive design to each experiment.
- Improve accessibility (labels, keyboard navigation, contrast).
- Extend functionality (e.g., more filter options, more SVG shapes, saving user settings).
